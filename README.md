## Smart Meter Project

Welcome to the Smart Meter Project repository! This project aims to develop a smart meter system that integrates energy monitoring, weather updates, and user interaction via a Telegram bot. The system is designed to enhance energy management and user engagement through real-time data updates and alerts.

### Overview
The Smart Meter Project utilizes various technologies such as Firebase for real-time database management, OpenWeatherMap API for weather updates, and Telegram for user interaction. The project aims to provide users with real-time energy consumption data, weather information, and alerts about unusual activities.

### Features
- **Energy Monitoring:** Real-time energy consumption tracking for multiple rooms and a hub.
- **Weather Updates:** Fetches and displays real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **User Alerts:** Sends alerts to users about energy consumption limits and suspicious activities.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the system via a Telegram bot to get updates on energy consumption and weather.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SanskrutiDhal/Smart-Meter.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
1. **Firebase Setup:**
   - Place your Firebase credentials file (`credentials.json`) in the project directory.

2. **Telegram Bot:**
   - Create a Telegram bot and obtain the API token.
   - Replace the placeholder `TOKEN` with your actual Telegram bot token in the code.

3. **OpenWeatherMap API:**
   - Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
   - Replace the placeholder `api_key` with your actual API key in the code.

### Usage
1. **Start the System:**
   - Run the main script to start the energy monitoring, weather updates, and Telegram bot:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
2. **Interact with the Bot:**
   - Use the following commands to interact with the bot:
     - `/start`: Start the bot and initialize monitoring.
     - `/room1`: Get the energy consumption for Room 1.
     - `/room2`: Get the energy consumption for Room 2.
     - `/hub`: Get the energy consumption for the Hub.

3. **Monitor Energy and Alerts:**
   - The system will automatically monitor energy consumption and send alerts for any unusual activities or consumption limits.
